## The Trapped Knight

Project was inspired by a chess game and a youtube video posted by Numberphile (an educational platform) in which an interesting character, Neil Sloane takes part. In this video Neil Sloane analyzes the squares visited by a knight moving on a spiral numbered board, where the rule is to always move to the lowest available unvisited square. It turns out that this sequence is finite. In step 2016, square 2084 is visited, after which there are no unvisited squares in a single move of the knight. This project was to write a program that creates a matrix of any size, fills it with numbers, and then shows the complete sequence of knight moves on a graph.
